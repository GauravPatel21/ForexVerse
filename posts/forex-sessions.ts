## Introduction
A common myth in trading is that "more hours equals more money." In Forex, the opposite is true. The market consists of three major sessions: Asian, London, and New York. Understanding the personality of each session is critical for your win rate.

## The Asian Session (Tokyo)
*   **Characteristics:** Low volatility, consolidation, range-bound behavior.
*   **The Trap:** Many breakout traders lose money here because price lacks the momentum to sustain a move. It often simply oscillates between support and resistance.
*   **Best For:** Range trading strategies and scalping pairs like USD/JPY or AUD/USD.

## The London Session
*   **The Awakening:** When London opens (approx. 3 AM EST), volume explodes. This is often where the "True Trend" of the day begins.
*   **The Frankfurt Fakeout:** Frequently, price will move one way during the Frankfurt open (1 hour before London) to induce traders, only to reverse aggressively when London officially opens.
*   **Best For:** Catching the "Low of the Day" or "High of the Day" formations.

## The New York Session
*   **The Powerhouse:** The New York open (8 AM EST) brings US Dollar volume.
*   **The Overlap (8 AM - 12 PM EST):** This is the holy grail. Both London and New York are open. Liquidity is at its peak, spreads are lowest, and volatility is highest.
*   **The Reversal:** Often, if London set a trend, New York might reverse it or accelerate it depending on economic news releases.

## The "Dead Zone"
Between the close of New York (5 PM EST) and the open of Tokyo, spreads widen significantly, and volume dries up. Trading during this time is essentially gambling against the spread.

## Summary
Do not trade when you are free; trade when the market is active. If there is no volume, there is no momentum. If there is no momentum, your technical analysis has a higher failure rate.

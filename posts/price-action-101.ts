## Introduction
Price action is the discipline of making trading decisions based on the raw movement of price, rather than lagging indicators. It is the language of the market, reflecting the aggregate psychology and order flow of all participants at any given moment.

## Key Concept Overview
Charts are often cluttered with moving averages, oscillators, and bands. While these tools calculate past data, they obscure the only truth in trading: the current price. By focusing on candlesticks and structure, a trader gains a direct line of sight into institutional intent.

## How It Works Mechanically
Price moves due to an imbalance between supply (sellers) and demand (buyers).
*   **Expansion:** Large, impulsive candles indicate aggressive participation from institutions.
*   **Contraction:** Small, tight candles indicate indecision or position accumulation.
*   **Rejection:** Long wicks indicate that price probed a level and was forced back, signaling a potential reversal.

## How to Apply It in Real Trading
1.  **Clean Your Charts:** Remove all indicators. Leave only the candlesticks.
2.  **Identify the Trend:** Is price making Higher Highs or Lower Lows?
3.  **Read the Reaction:** Watch how price behaves at key psychological numbers (e.g., 1.0500). Does it stall? Does it wick?
4.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Do not predict. Wait for a candle to close to confirm the sentiment.

## Mistakes Traders Make
*   **Over-analysis:** Trying to read every single tick on a 1-minute chart leads to fatigue and false signals.
*   **Ignoring Context:** A bullish candle pattern has low probability if it forms directly into a strong resistance level.
*   **Indicator Dependency:** Looking for a "crossover" instead of understanding *why* price is moving.

## Summary
Mastering price action is not about memorizing patterns; it is about understanding the logic of buyers and sellers. It provides a clearer, faster, and more professional method for analyzing risk and probability.

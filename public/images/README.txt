Store your blog post screenshots and images here.

CRITICAL WORKFLOW WARNING:
1. If you are using an AI Editor (like Bolt, StackBlitz, etc.), you MUST upload your images HERE (into this folder) using the editor's upload functionality.
2. Do NOT upload images directly to the GitHub website.
3. Why? The AI Editor is the "Source of Truth". If you upload to GitHub, the Editor doesn't see them. When the Editor pushes the next update, it will DELETE the files on GitHub because they don't exist in the Editor.

Example usage in your .ts post files:
![My Chart Analysis](/images/my-chart.png)

1. Save your image as 'my-chart.png' in this folder.
2. Ensure the image is on its own line in the content string.

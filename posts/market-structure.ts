## Introduction
Market structure is the roadmap of price. It tells you the direction of the dominant trend and warns you when that trend is ending. Without understanding structure, you are navigating without a compass.

## Key Concept Overview
Markets exist in three states:
1.  **Uptrend:** Characterized by Higher Highs (HH) and Higher Lows (HL).
2.  **Downtrend:** Characterized by Lower Lows (LL) and Lower Highs (LH).
3.  **Consolidation:** Price ranges between a defined high and low.

## Mechanics of Structure
*   **BOS (Break of Structure):** When price closes beyond a previous structural high in an uptrend (or low in a downtrend), it confirms trend continuation.
*   **CHoCH (Change of Character):** The first sign of a potential reversal. In an uptrend, this happens when price breaks below the last Higher Low.

## How to Apply It in Real Trading
1.  **Identify the Current Range:** What is the most recent High and Low?
2.  **Trade With the Flow:** If the market is printing Higher Highs, look exclusively for buy setups at Higher Lows.
3.  **Spot the Break:** Wait for a BOS to confirm momentum before looking for the next entry.

## Mistakes Traders Make
*   **Counter-Trend Trading:** Trying to catch the "top" of a strong uptrend is a low-probability strategy. Trend continuation is statistically more likely than reversal.
*   **Confusing Timeframes:** An uptrend on the 5-minute chart might just be a pullback on the 4-Hour downtrend. Always respect the higher timeframe structure.

## Summary
Structure is the context for every trade. Before executing, ask yourself: "What is the structure doing?" If you cannot answer, you should not be in the market.
